### Hi there üëã

I am √Åbel Herfort, currently 19 years old and I live in Hungary. I work as a full stack Java developer, I am familiar with several languages and technologies. I have gained a lot of experience in game server development in particular. At FyreZone Ltd. I have learned a lot about running complicated software on production environment, proper workflow and team management. I have also been involved in several other projects where I have held different developer positions.

I have a passion for learning new technologies, as well as learning new skills in development (this applies for me in all spects of life). I have been developing Minecraft servers and general programming since I was 13 years old, and have always been curious about new concepts. I'm ready to explore new opportunities and take on challenges in the world of IT‚Äîstick with me.
